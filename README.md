# Max UV Index Curve in London
In this project, we created an interactive visualisation showing the maximum UV index in London for each month of the year. We show the variation in the maximum UV index throughout the day for each month. The typical behaviour is for the UV index to increase from morning till it peaks around 12.00 pm then it drops towards evening. 

This plot could be useful to identify months of the year when sun protection should be worn and to identify the time of day that sun protection is required during different months. 

A static screenshot of our visualisation is shown below. **Click it** to view the full interactive UV index plot.

## Further Info: 
- The **uv_london.ipnb** details what data was used, how it was cleaned and formatted and how the visualisation was created. It contains all code used in this project. 
- UV Index Data for London was supplied by UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) - we used the 2019 and 2020 UV index data recorded at the st Thomas Hospital site. UKHSA UV index data from sites across the UK can be viewed [here](https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/uv-index-graphs).
